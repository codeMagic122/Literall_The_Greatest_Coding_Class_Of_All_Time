## Introduction
Welcome to the second tutorial in this course! Like always, my goal today is to blow your minds - this time with a fancy little thing called Natural Language Processing. Natural Language Processing, or NLP is essentially a methodology for analyzing, understanding, and giving context to groupings of words progromatically. It's extremely powerful, only growing in use, and today, you're going to learn how to use it!

In order to learn about NLP, we're going to build a speech analyzer, that will allow its users to input a speech of their choice, and then figure out if that speech aligns more with one oppinion, or another. Here's how it will work:
1) The user gives us three speeches - The first speech will be in support of an idea, the second speech will be in opposition to an idea, and the last speech will be compared to the previous two speeches to figure out if the person giving that third speech is in support or opposition to an idea.
2) We take all three speeches, and use NLP to remove unimportant words (Like 'is' and 'and'), and then we figure out the words that are most commonly used in the opposition and support speech, as well as in the speech that we're checking
3) We figure out if the wording used in the speech to check is more similar to the speech that's in support or opposition, and then tell our user how that speech aligns

## Installing Dependencies
Before we can start using natural language processing, we must first import the requisite packages. Begin by heading over to replt.it, creating a Python REPL, and importing the following packages

```python
import spacy
import json
import string
from collections import Counter
```

## Basic Setup
The first thing you all need to understand about NLP, is the fundamental manner in which it functions. Simply put, Natural Language Processing starts by dividing up sentences into bunches of tokens that seperate individual words and punctuation. Then NLP santizes sentences by removing 'stop words' (words like 'for', 'and', 'but', etc.), and lemmatizes words into their simplest forms (e.g. running becomes run, swimming becomes swim). Lemmatization is especially crucial because it allows us to compare words with nearly identical meanings, even if those words' forms are different. 

To begin, let's find the three speeches that we want to use for our project. Feel free to copy my speeches below, but if you want to find your own, make sure that they encompass the whole issue - meaning that they don't make one argument but the entire argument.

```python
proSpeech = "La Boheme in the name of God the compassionate the merciful your excellency secretary-general of the United Nations president of the United Nations General Assembly ladies and gentlemen peace be upon you 24 years have passed since the signing of the Oslo Accords an interim agreement that set a five-year period for bringing an end to the Israeli occupation granting hope to the Palestinian people that they would soon achieve independence within their state and achieve peace between Palestinians and Israelis what is left of this hope today president ladies and gentlemen we recognize the State of Israel on the 1967 borders but Israel is continuous refusal to recognize these borders has put into question the mutual recognition we signed in Oslo in 1993 since my speech before your August assembly last year when I appealed for 2017 to be the year for ending the Israeli occupation of the territory of the state of Palestine the Israeli government has relentlessly pursued its settlement campaign on our land in contravention of all international conventions and the relevant resolutions on the question of Palestine it has also persisted with its flagrant disregard for the two-state solution resorting to procrastination policies and tactics and revising pretexts to evade its responsibility to end its occupation of the territory of the state of Palestine instead of addressing the underlying issues and resolving the root causes of the conflict it has tried to divert international attention towards secondary issues actually caused by its colonial policies while we call just as the international community continues to do for an end to the Israeli occupation of the territory of our state it incites and makes false accusations pretense there is no Palestinian partner and imposes unreasonable obstructive conditions Israel as well aware as you are all that is that it's occupation breeds incitement and violence and this military occupation by Israel of our land has now lasted for over half a century ten years ago we agreed together to establish a tripartite committee comprising the United States Palestine and Israel in order to address the issue of incitement and that the decision lies with the United States and this committee has worked for some time but then it was cancelled and since then we have been calling for the revival of this committee to no avail so who is during the incitement now who is now trying to maintain incitement what is strange it is thus very strange to hear some of those who hold the responsibility to end this occupation referring to it as an a half occupation or an alleged occupation so what what do you mean by alleged occupation for 50 years we have been languishing under the yoke of occupation and now somebody who is responsible is saying that this is an alleged occupation I believe this is not fair and incorrect and unacceptable the continuation of this occupation is an affront to Israel and the international community the United Nations bares illegal political moral and humanitarian obligation to end this occupation and enable the Palestinian people to live in freedom and prosperity and their independent state of Palestine with East Jerusalem the occupied East Jerusalem as its capital on the 4th of June 1967 borders this is your responsibility this is the responsibility of the international unity beyond any doubt draining the quagmire of colonial occupation of our land and ending its unjust oppressive and illegal practices against our people would have a great bearing to fight terrorism and deprive terrorist groups of one of the key rallying cries they exploit to promote their of securin test ideas therefore we reiterate that ending the Israeli occupation of our land is of urgency and it is needed to supplement the efforts that we are all undertaking to confront such groups we Palestinians are against internal and international organizations regardless of its nature its source or its character we are standing against international terrorism and we are fighting it president ladies and gentlemen we have explored every avenue and exerted far-reaching efforts to achieve peace with our Israeli neighbors and together with the Arab and Islamic states have adopted an invaluable initiative the Arab Peace Initiative aimed at resolving the Palestinian and arab-israeli conflict according to this initiative upon Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967 namely Gulen and Lebanese forms occupied in 1967 the Arab and Islamic states would recognize Israel and normalize relations with its so what was the response of Israel to initiative 57 Arab and Islamic states said they are ready that if Israel withdraws from those territories occupied in 1967 all these states will immediately recognize Israel and normalize relation with it and Israel is not interested there was also the quartet roadmap in 2003 put forward by the quartet for peace endorsed by the Security Council and accepted by Palestine it was also rejected by the Israeli government so Israel is above the law and to break this stalemate and the peace process and to ensure successful peace efforts there came the French initiative aimed at salvaging the peace process and the two-state solution led to holding the Paris conference earlier this year which was attended by 70 States 70 States I repeat and for international organizations all these efforts were met with the rejection and boycotting by Israel furthermore President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China have launched the initiatives for peace and the latest of these peace efforts all of which we are thankful for is being led by the United States President Donald Trump where are these initiatives and why Israel is not accepting these initiatives so on our part we have also repeatedly tried to revive the peace process and called on the Israeli prime minister to affirm to only affirm his commitment to the two-state solution and sit with us at the negotiations table to delineate the borders between Israel and the of Palestine in order to open a path for meaningful negotiations to resolve all other final status issues sitting together resolving the issue of borders and then discuss other matters unfortunately it was rejected by the Prime Minister we continued our genuine efforts for success of the peace process and despite these efforts Israel continues to breach its commitments and to obstruct efforts by continuing to build settlements everywhere building settlements everywhere there is no place left for the state of Palestine and this is not acceptable for us and for you you have the responsibility Palestine Israel also rejects the two-state solution and this poses a real threat to both people's the Israelis and Palestinians alike and this compels us to undertake a comprehensive strategic review of the entire process ladies and gentlemen commitment to peace should be from one side a commitment by one side to peace is never enough to achieve peace we have warned in the past and continue to warn of Israeli policies either we are free or not free we have warned in the past and continue to warn of Israeli policies aimed at entrenching the occupation and colonial facts on the ground in East Jerusalem we said that these policies fueled religious animosity that could lead to a religious conflict we have called on the Israeli government to uphold the historic and legal status Co of the holy sites in the city however the Israeli government since its occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967 yes it is an occupying power Jerusalem is occupied Israel has repeatedly annexed Jerusalem by a uni rattler unilateral decision Israel just decided to annex Golan and it did so we rejected that at that time and we still rejected today alongside the whole international community including the Security Council that have been many resolutions adopted by the Security Council the highest authority in the world stating that this annexation process is illegal to whom should we go the resolution the Security Council and those of the General Assembly are not implemented so to whom should we go we're not going towards terrorism or violence Jerusalem is an occupied City and Israel's decisions and practices there are null and void null and void and illegal in their entirety the same applies to all Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory it is an occupied territory as Ravus attempts to change the historic status quo in our codes and in particular with a V the state an integrity of al-aqsa mosque can only be described as playing with fire and an infringement upon our responsibilities as well as those of Brotherly Jordan both of the both of us are responsible for the city we koushin the Israeli government of the implications of such an aggression and we hold it fully responsible for the consequences don't ever try to go towards a religious war it is really dangerous for you and for us we don't want it our conflict is political let it remain political stay away from religious issues president ladies and gentlemen despite this ongoing occupation and its oppressive policies and practices we have been able to build the institutions of our state competently which has been recognized by a majority of member states of this organization 130 138 states among you the majority of the membership I seize this opportunity once again to thank all these countries that have recognised the state of Palestine and that have voted for upgrading the status of the of the State of Palestine ad the United Nations by doing so you are addressing a part of the historical injustice afflicted our people and endured by our people this also supports the objective of peace between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East and across the world at large last year before this August assembly I stressed in my speech that the status quo in the occupied territory of the state of Palestine is not sustainable however as the situation has only deteriorated due to Israel its insistence on preserving its occupation aggressive policies and endless violations of international law we must once again if this is the case : we on Israel as the the occupying power to fully respect and uphold all its obligations stemming from this occupation and also bear the consequences we cannot continue so be an authority without any authority we cannot remain an authority without any authority or to allow this occupation to continue without costs we are fast approaching this point if they don't want the two-state solution and they don't want peace let them bear their responsibilities and the consequences of these responsibilities because we're not going to bear any responsibilities in this case the two-state solution today is in jeopardy we cannot as Palestinians stand still in the face of this threat targeting our national political and social existence on our land and endangers regional and international peace and security we will have to take steps or look for alternatives to preserve our national existence and at the same time to keep open the prospect for peace and security however all the options that we are seeking will be peaceful peaceful peaceful in such a situation it is our right to search for alternatives that preserve our rights and protect our land and our people from any and from an entrenching system of appetite that came to an end in South Africa long time ago but it still exists in Palestine is this acceptable can the world accept an apartheid regime in the first 21st century in Palestine why it is there on the other hand we have called on the International Criminal Court this is alright if nobody wants to listen to us then let us seek all avenues so we have called on the International Criminal Courts to open an investigation and to prosecute Israeli officials for their involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people and we will continue to pursue our accessions to international conventions protocols and organizations as Palestine has acquired observer status in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 67 / 19 of 2012 I will call for convening of the Palestinian National Council in the near future to operationalize this strat strategic review president ladies and gentlemen we as Palestinians in Arab and the whole world have the the choice of the international law and the two-state solution on the borders of 1967 and we will grant every chance for the efforts being undertaken by President Donald Trump and the quartet and the international community at large to I achieve a historic agreement or deal we have heard that they are seeking a historic deal and we would like to thank them we hope that this will take place so we stress the two-state solution enabling the state of Palestine to live side by side with the State of Israel in security and peace but if the two-state solution were to be destroyed due to the creation of a one-state reality with two systems apartheid from the unchecked imposition of this occupation that is rejected by our people and the international community this would be a failure and neither you nor we will have any other choice but to continue the struggle and demand full equal rights for all inhabitants of historic Palestine this is not a threat but we are warning of the realities and the consequences as a result of ongoing Israeli policies that are gravely undermining the two-state solution what do they want let them talk about other issues but our choice will remain the two-state solution our problem ladies and gentlemen is with the Israeli colonial occupation and not with Judaism as a religion judy's for us Palestinians Christians and Muslims will never be considered a threat it is an Abrahamic religion like Islam and Christianity God Almighty says in the Quran in the name of God the compassionate the merciful we do not distinguish between his messengers so all messengers are equal Muhammad Jesus and others all these religions are equal and we are not distinguished distinguishing between prophets or messengers and on this occasion we are congratulating the Jews for the occasion or on the occasion of the new year and we we will also congratulate and we would like to congratulate Muslims for the new head jury year starting tomorrow so this is a demonstration of approachment between religions president ladies and gentlemen we have dutifully upheld our responsibility towards our people in the Gaza Strip in spite of the division since in 2007 since then we have provided all forms of support on our own to our people in Gaza who are gravely suffering from the cruel Israeli blockade we have repeatedly affirmed that and no one is more conscious about the interests of our people in Gaza Strip we are keen on achieving the interests of people in Gaza we said that there will be no state in Gaza and there will be no Palestinian state without the Gaza Strip State in Gaza this is a false dream and our state will only complete with the Gaza Strip and today I must express my relief the agreement reached in in Cairo as a result of Egyptian efforts we are thankful for these efforts aimed at nullifying the measures taken by Hamas following the division including the formation of a government now the government has been consult and now there is commitment to the national unity or national consensus government to enable it exercise its authority in Gaza Strip and to allow for general elections to be held this agreement has been reached and we are satisfied with this agreement and next week our government is going to the Gaza Strip to assume its responsibilities we wish the governor and all success president ladies and gentlemen also in my speech before this assembly last year I appealed to the British government the government of Great Britain to rectify the grave injustice its inflicted upon the Palestinian people when it issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917 promising Jews a national homeland in Palestine despite the fact that Palestine was inhabited by the Palestinian people ninety-seven percent of the popular popular at that time were Palestinians we were disregarded again Palestine was inhabited by the Palestinian people and was among the most progressive and prosperous countries and should not have been colonized or placed under the mandate of a great power the British government has not taken any step until this moment to correct this historical injustice against our people it should apologise and provide us with compensations and recognize the state of Palestine we talked to them at length and so far they haven't responded what is even worse that in November they want to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of this crime against our people the Silence of the international community as to the Israeli aggressive policies has emboldened Israel to continue such policies let me remind you that Israel has violated international resolutions since its establishment it has violated the United Nations Charter and continues to do so as well as resolutions 8 1 1 9 4 2 4 2 dividing Palestine and it said through art articles 42 it says that those who conduct aggression against the land of others will be defeated by by by force Israel has taken a large part of our territory and it was not deterred by the United Nations there is also resolution 194 providing for the return of refugees at that time however the United Nations has not adopted any resolution and there is also another resolution calling for withdraw world resolution 3 3 8 and resolution 23 34 of the Security Council last year so where is this resolution if the United Nations cannot implement its resolutions who would implement these resolutions Israel doesn't want to Israel is above the law is it above the law ladies and gentlemen there is double standard in dealing with countries this is your responsibility president to salvage the peace process and the two-state solution I urge this organization and your honorable States to do the following first actively pursue efforts to bring an end to the Israeli occupation of the state of Palestine within a set timeframe let's say within this time frame the occupation will come to an end it is no longer enough to issue generic statements calling for the of occupation and the achievement of peace without a deadline efforts must be made to implement the Arab Peace Initiative including the just solution for the Palestinian refugee question in accordance with the resolution 194 the Arab initiative was great in addressing the issue of refugees when mentioning adjust and agreed upon solution not imposed upon a certain party in accordance with resolution 194 where is the mistake so these resolutions were disregarded by Israel Israel has ridden roughshod over these resolutions to whom should we go to whom should we complain second acted to bring to a halt all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory as demanded in numerous United Nation Nations resolutions including the most recent resolution 23 34 in addition to the operative paragraphs of the Fourth Geneva Convention so an occupying power should not expel the people from their land this is the text of the Fourth Geneva Convention who is responsible for implementing these texts Israel says no and what are we saying as international community third ensure international protection to the land and people of the state of Palestine until the end of the occupation as we are unable to provide protection to our people given all the forces and the arms that we are facing every day who would protect us if you don't many a time we have tabled draft resolutions and these go in vain forth demanded that Israel endorses and commits to the borders of 1967 as the the basis for the two-state solution and set such borders in line with international resolutions once we delineate the borders each party can act in its territory as it pleases without affecting or damaging the rights of the other party now Israel builds wherever it wishes demolishing houses every day even schools are being demolished hospitals nobody raises an eyebrow now i v i must ask you all the member states of the united nations those who have recognized israel they should state that they recognized Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders thus aligning themselves with international resolutions and reaffirming their commitment to these resolutions even those recognized Israel on the basis of 181 resolution 181 was violated allow me to ask a question where is where are the borders of Israel that you are recognizing where are these borders how can you recognize a state that has no borders it has not even decided on its own borders and international law states that the the state is a land with borders and Israel has no borders so how can you recognize a state that has no clear borders sixth I call on all states to end all forms of direct and indirect involvement with and support to the illegal Israeli colonial settlement regime on the land of the occupied state of Palestine in accordance with UN resolutions and with the affirmative of states in this regard and similar to the international community's approach to words the apartheid regime in South Africa we should not deal with settlements we should not condone settlements there's the blacklist of countries who are dealing illegally with Israeli settlements should be exposed and revealed seven I urge those states that have not recognized the state of Palestine yet to do so I don't understand how recognizing the state of Palestine on the borders of 1967 there could be minor amendments between the two parties but the foundation or the basis is 1967 so our borders are well known where are the borders of Israel I don't understand how recognizing the state of Palestine harms the chances of peace especially since we Palestinians have recognized Israel on the 1967 borders eight we look to the Security Council to approve our application for full membership of the State of Palestine to the United Nations what do we lack what is there that is missing every day we prove that we are eligible for such status all those who support the two-state solution should recognize the two states not one state Palestine and Israel if you recognize Israel you should recognize Palestine ix we urge the international community to continue to provide economic and financial support to the Palestinian people to achieve self-reliance if the occupation comes to an end we will tell you thank you we will be self-reliant unfortunately because there is occupation we can only seek assistance and we are grateful to you because you are rendering such assistance help us to get rid of occupation and we will we would thank you for your help we also urge you to continue providing support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinian refugees in the nearest Unruh an order for it to continue rendering humanitarian assistance in this respect we are warning that there are attempts to eliminate item 7 on the agenda of the Human Rights Council or to change the Mandate of UNRWA and also there are efforts to obstruct the issuance of the list of companies operating in Israeli settlements this is a blacklist why should we hide this list it is similar to terrorism everybody should see this list to know who violates international law and who respects such law so again the black list of companies operating in Israeli settlements in the territory of the occupied state of Palestine tenth we once again affirm our commitment to respect human rights and international conventions and to implement the United Nations sustainable development agenda 2030 and the Paris agreement on climate change and all other treaties and vengeance that we have acceded to anything that we have acceded to or adopted we respect it and we go side by side with the international community were part of this interest community president the state of Palestine will reflect on these imperatives and draft resolutions as appropriate to be presented to the United Nations General Assembly we call upon you all of you to vote in favor of these resolutions with the clear aim of preserving the two-state solution and salvaging and promoting the chances for achieving peace and to achieve prosperity for the Israelis and Palestinians alike and the peoples of the region at large in closing allow me ladies and gentlemen to salute our great people who remain steadfast in their homeland despite the suffering those who are struggling against foreign occupation peacefully and the culture of peace is prevailing among Palestinians among all Palestinians who are those people who join - ISIL none of them is from Palestine what does this mean I salute the our people in Jerusalem who have given one of the most bright examples of peaceful popular resistance against the Israeli colonial occupation when they prevented them from praying they prayed outside and they were praying and they were victorious I salute our people in exile and in diaspora I salute our people who remain steadfast in the West Bank and also the besieged Gaza Strip I salute our glorious martyrs and our courageous prisoners who are there in the Israeli jails I tell them all that freedom is coming it is inevitable it will come and that occupation shall come to an end it will either be the Independence of the State of Palestine to live side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel on the 1967 borders or equal or if they want if they wish equal rights for all of the inhabitants of the land of historic Palestine from the river to the sea will they accept so when South Africa was liberated from the apartheid regime Nelson Mandela said I am grateful to the whole world and the United Nations that have contributed to and supported the end of apartheid in South Africa and it so happened but Nelson Mandela added our victory is not complete until and the victory is rendered to the Palestinian people so we are entrusted and you are entrusted to end apartheid in Palestine all of us even the superpower they should stand by us this is a trust you should fulfill the trust are you going to do so thank you I hope so [Applause] oh no the last homily on behalf of the General Assembly I have the honor to welcome to the United Nations His Excellency mr. Mahmoud Abbas president of the state of Palestine and to invite him now to address the assembly similar Nara in the name of God the merciful the compassionate your excellency mr. Peter Thompson president of the General Assembly your excellency mr. ban ki-moon secretary-general of the United Nations excellencies ladies and gentlemen heads of delegations peace and God's blessing be upon you all I had hoped that I would not be compelled to deliver this statement today had the cause of my people been justly resolved genuinely heard and that hearts and minds would have acted to lift my people from oppression as you all are well aware we have accepted the primacy of international law the resolutions of international legitimacy and made a historic and immense sacrifice when the PLO the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people accepted to establish the state of Palestine on the 4th of June 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital what more can be asked of us we remain committed to the agreements reached with Israel since 1993 however Israel must reciprocate this commitment and must act forthwith to resolve all of the final status issues it must cease all of its settlement colonization activities and its aggressions against our cities villages and refugee camps it must cease its policies of collective punishment it's demolition of Palestinian homes it's extrajudicial executions and the arrests of our people in addition to releasing the thousands of prisoners and detainees it must also cease its aggression and provocations against the Holy al-aqsa mosque for all of these policies and practices prevent an environment in which peace can prevail in our region how can anyone seeking peace commit such actions in this regard we reaffirm that we cannot accept the current situation we will never accept the humiliation of our people we will never accept temporary or interim solutions our people will never accept to forego their national institutions and achievements having attained them through great sacrifice suffering and pain we will preserve the independence of Palestinian decision-making and we will act to fulfill the aspirations of our people via political and diplomatic means while relying on international law the legitimacy of international resolutions via the United Nations and all international fora we will seek to mobilize Arab and international efforts towards achieving this end we will not accept the continuation of the current situation the 1993 Oslo accord was intended to end the occupation to achieve the independence of the state of Palestine within five years yet Israel renounced the agreements it signed and to this moment it persists with its occupation and continues to expand its illegal settlements which undermines the realization of the two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders does Israel want one state despite the adoption of 12 resolutions by the Security Council condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories since 1967 none of these resolutions were implemented thus encouraging Israel to continue its plans for the Caeser of more Palestinian land in the West Bank including East Jerusalem with impunity the violent actions of Israeli settlers have gone as far as the formation of terrorist groups that set entire families on fire kill them destroy properties and uproot the trees that are the livelihoods of Palestinian families Israel's disrespect and contemptuous policies have gone as far as attempts to legalize the settlements and the settlers colonizing our occupied land since 1967 it even led to the Israeli Prime Minister claiming that the call for the cessation of settlements and their despair internment constitutes ethnic cleansing ethnic cleansing all such attempts are null and void and it will constitute a clear grave violation of international law so who then is practicing ethnic cleansing in this regard I am compelled to warn you again that what the Israeli government is doing in pursuit of its expansionist settlement plans will destroy whatever possibility is left for the two-state solution along the 1967 borders the settlements are illegal in every aspect and any manifestation the settlements are illegal we will therefore continue to exert all efforts for the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the settlements and the terror of the settlers and we are undertaking at the moment extensive consultations with Arab countries and other friendly countries on this matter and we hope that no one will cast a veto against this draft resolution Israel's racial discrimination against the Palestinian people has become a daily reality as it continues to favor the Israeli settlers on our occupied land including by granting them permits for residential construction as well as for factories economic projects and instruct infrastructure such as roads electricity and water networks while at the same time preventing the Palestinian owners the owners of the land from use of their land and profiting them from developing their economy in the West Bank including Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley and the Palestinian chores on the Dead Sea it continues with its illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip and continues to alter the identity and status of the occupied East Jerusalem to commit aggressions and provocations against our Christian and Muslim holy sites especially al-aqsa mosque these continued Israeli aggressions against our Muslim and Christian holy sites amounts to playing with fire again it amounts to playing with fire no one knows what will happen if these aggressions continue all of these Israeli policies actions and measures are the reasons behind the failure of all international efforts and particularly those of the international quartet over the past 13 years just as Israel had sabotaged the efforts of successful successive American administrations over the decades here I must once again appeal to you to provide international protection for the Palestinian people suffering under occupation since 1967 in the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip I extend my deep appreciation in this regard to the secretary-general and the Security Council members who convened an area meeting of the council to explore the options for international protection for my people and I urge that these efforts continue if you do not ensure our protection then who will who can provide us with international protection if the United Nations is unable to do so mr. president ladies and gentlemen Israel today continues its attempt to evade an international conference for peace which is a proposal by France a proposal that received the support of the majority of the world's countries in June of this year a ministerial meeting was held in Paris to prepare for this conference it was attended by 28 countries along with three intergovernmental organizations it remains our hope that such a conference will lead to the establishment of a mechanism and a time frame for an end to occupation in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the international community the principle of land for peace the Arab Peace Initiative which calls inter alia for a just and a great solution for Palestinian refugees in accordance with resolution 194 we hope that all states of the world will support the convening of this International Peace Conference before the end of this year if there is no international peace conference held and no direct negotiations between us and the Israelis then how can peace be made no peace conference and no negotiations how can we speak about peace how can we make peace mr. president ladies and gentlemen instead of Israel acknowledging the atrocities it committed and continues to commit against our people the Israeli prime minister has the audacity to criticize Palestine statement at the Arab League summit in walk shot in Mauritania because we referred to the buffer the declaration I say to him today that our recognition of the existence of the State of Israel in 1993 Eric a recognition which remains valid to this moment is not a complementary recognition Israel must reciprocate with a similar recognition of the state of Palestine we recognize Israel and continue to recognize Israel however Israel must recognize the state of Palestine and put an end to its occupation of our land so that the state of Palestine can coexist alongside the State of Israel in peace and security as good neighbors while each within secure and recognized borders mr. president ladies and gentlemen there is no conflict between us and the Jewish religion and its people not at all our conflict is with the Israeli occupation of our land we respect the Jewish religion we respect the Jewish religion fully it is a monotheistic religion and we respected just as we respect other religions and we condemn in this regard the disaster that befell the Jewish people during World War Two in Europe the Holocaust and we view it as one of the most heinous crimes that was perpetrated against humanity a historic reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Israelis requires that Israel acknowledges its responsibility for the Nakba the Nakba that was inflicted on our Palestinian people and is still being inflicted to this very day this will open a new era of coexistence and will serve to build bridges rather than walls I believe that the Arab Peace Initiative presents reasonable innovative solution yet Israel continues to insist on being selective picking and choosing from this initiative such as the establishment of relations with the Arab countries first without ending its occupation of Palestinian and Arab lands first this is definitely a recipe for more conflict in our region we will not accept this and no one else will the Arab Peace Initiative should be implemented in full from A to Z and Israel must understand that mr. president ladies and gentlemen by the end of this year 100 years would have passed since the Balfour Declaration 70 years since an Nakba of the Palestinian people and 50 years since Israel occupied the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip yes 100 years have passed since the notorious Balfour Declaration the infamous Balfour Declaration by which Britain Great Britain gave without any write authority or consent from anyone the land of Palestine to other people this paved the way for the Nakba of Palestinian people their dispossession their displacement from their land and as if this were not enough the British Mandate interpreted this declaration into policies and measures that contributed to the perpetration of the most heinous crimes against a peaceful people in their own land a people that never attacked anyone or / took in a war against someone therefore we ask Great Britain as we approach 100 years since this infamous declaration to draw the necessary lessons and to bear its historic legal political material and moral responsibility for the consequences of this declaration including an apology to the Palestinian people for the catastrophes misery and injustice this declaration created and to act to rectify these these disasters and remedy its consequences including by the recognition of the State of Palestine this is the least Great Britain can do in addition Israel since 1948 has persisted in its content contempt for international legitimacy by violating United Nations General Assembly resolution 181 to the partition resolution which called for the establishment of two states on the historic land of Palestine according to a specific partition plan Israel for Israeli forces seized more land than those allotted to it and this constituted a grave breach of articles 39 41 and 42 of the United Nations Charter in the preamble of resolution 181 to the partition resolution in paragraph C of the preamble it is stated and I quote the Security Council determined as a threat to the peace breach of the peace or act of aggression in accordance with article 39 of the Charter any attempt to alter by force the settlement envisioned visited by this resolution regrettably however the Security Council is not upholding its responsibilities to hold Israel accountable for its Caeser of the territory allotted to the Palestinian state over half of the Palestinian territory was overtaken by Israel again it is not upholding its responsibility to hold Israel accountable for its seizure of the territory allotted to the Palestinian state according to the partition resolution I appealed to you ladies and gentlemen to read this resolution again mr. president ladies and gentlemen we continue our efforts to build the foundations of a culture of peace among our people we stand firmly against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations we condemn it regardless of its source our region is a victim a prime victim of terrorism and it has endured its wrath over many years we support the unity of people and the territorial integrity as well as political solutions for all of the conflicts in Syria Libya Iraq and elsewhere we also support the efforts of the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to strengthen the foundations of legitimacy in Yemen we support the efforts deployed to overcome terrorism extremism secularism and violence I appeal to you to stand united against terrorism which knows no religion terrorism knows no religion in this context I wish to reaffirm that there is no way to defeat terrorism and extremism no way to achieve security and stability in our region without ending the Israeli occupation of Palestine and ensuring the freedom and independence of the Palestinian people so fighting terrorism and extremism begins when we end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and as such terrorism will end mr. president ladies and gentlemen we continue our genuine and dedicated efforts to achieve Palestinian reconciliation with the formation of a national unity government in accordance with the political reform of the PLO and the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections we are committed to reconstruction in Gaza to alleviate the hardship of our people and to lift the illegal blockade imposed on our people mr. president we extend our hands to those who want to build peace but the question remains and persists is there any leadership in Israel the occupying power that desires to make a true peace is there any leadership that will abandon the mentality of hegemony expansionism and colonialism that will recognize the rights of our people and will end the historical injustice inflicted upon them it is Israel's breach of the agreements it had signed and its failure to comply with the obligations that have led us to the deadlock and stalemate we remain in now the state of Palestine an observer state in the United Nations is a state under occupation 138 countries supported the state of Palestine to become an ass an observer state in the United Nations the Executive Committee of the PLO the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people wherever they may be acts on behalf of our people as their government and the Palestine National Council is the Parliament of the state of Palestine which is in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolution 67 / 19 which was should on the 29th of November 2012 we rely on the international community we haven't lost hope yet we rely on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities we call on those countries that have heard the rights of our people to rectify this injustice moreover we appeal to countries that have not recognized the state of Palestine to do so because those who believe in the two-state solution and everyone speaks about the two-state solution should recognize both states and not just one of them mr. president ladies and gentlemen in this 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly I call on you to declare 2017 as the International Year to end the Israeli occupation of our land and our people in June 2017 half a century of this abhorrent Israeli occupation would have passed I also appeal to you in follow-up to resolution 67 / 19 with the adoption of the resolution to enable Israel to present and co-sponsor resolutions beyond the question of Palestine I call on you to support our efforts to enhance palestine's legal and political status by granting it additional responsibilities to chair committees and international groups as we continue our efforts thanks to your support for full membership in international organizations to be granted full membership in international organizations based on the above the international community is called is called upon now more than ever to exert all efforts to bring an end to the Israeli occupation of the land of the state of Palestine as you know this is the longest and last occupation in contemporary history the international community's ability to advance the rights of our people to ensure their exercise of those very same rights and to end the oppression and injustice imposed on our people for seven decades would surely be a unique opportunity for peace stability and coexistence in our region and between the Palestinian and Israeli people this will create a better future for the current generation and generations to follow it will be the beginning and the basis for ending extremism and violence in our region and in the world I thank you for your attention and I hope from the depth of my heart that the Israeli occupation of our land will end that we can defeat terrorism that conflicts will come to an end and that peace will prevail in our region and around the world we and our people will continue to open the doors for peace and we will do all we can to grant our people freedom and independence we will remain steadfast on our land and we will work to ensure the future of our of the next generations mr. president ladies and gentlemen it is my hope that I will not have to deliver this very same statement again next year it is our collective responsibility to ensure that 2017 is the year of ending the occupation will you uphold this responsibility will you uphold this responsibility I truly hope so peace and God's blessing be upon you all thank you when the Israeli Prime Minister spoke to the UN there was one thing he hardly talked about the Palestinians he instead focused on Iran claiming Israel had discovered a new nuclear storage facility in Tehran he then went on to boast about the strength of his relationship with the trump administration so I want to use this opportunity to express Israel's appreciation to President Trump and ambassador Haley for the unwavering support they've provided Israel at the United Nations the Palestinian President gave his message the moment he took to the podium and good place at little mayor Jerusalem is not for sale I hope Walker's Sharman and the Palestinian people's rights are not up for bargaining he went on to express his frustration at the actions of the Trump administration we awaited his peace initiative without most patients but we were shocked by decisions and actions he undertook that completely contradict the role and commitment of the US towards the peace process it is ironic that the American administration still talks about what they call the deal of the century the Palestinians believe that by his actions it's not just that President Trump is not an honest broker he's actively on Israel's side and when you listen to the way at a news conference before he left New York he described the man he's put in charge of peace efforts his own son-in-law Jared Kushner it's not hard to see why I think the two-state will happen I think we're going to go down the two-state road and I'm glad I got it out and Jared who's so involved he loves Israel he loves Israel but he's also going to be very fair with the Palestinians he understands it takes two people to be happy to groups of people to be happy everybody's got to be happy and that's why it's so tough the fact he barely mentioned the Palestinians I think shows the confidence of Benjamin Netanyahu in what's going to come out of the Jared Kushner peace plan which were being told we filled in the next four months the Palestinians meanwhile already I think believe they're going to have to reject what's in that plan James BAE's al Jazeera at the United Nations a

through a comprehensive approach it's been almost 15 years since the Arab Peace Initiative was launched which called for normalization of relations with Israel in exchange for his forces pulling out from areas they occupied in 1967 but nothing has changed establishing a Palestinian state is still a distant hope and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has warned Israel against building more

antiSpeech = "The Assembly will hear statement by His Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu Prime Minister Minister for Foreign Affairs Minister for the economy Minister for communications and Minister for regional cooperation of the State of Israel may I request protocol to escort His Excellency I prayed the pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of Israel I invite him to address the General Assembly Applause distinguished delegates ladies and gentlemen when I spoke here three years ago Israel stood alone among the nations of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this hall only Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with Iran we oppose it because it threatens our future even our very survival we opposed it because the deal paved Iran's path to a nuclear arsenal and by lifting the sanctions it's fueled Iran's campaign of carnage and conquest throughout the Middle East we oppose it we oppose it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie that Iran is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons now Israel exposed that lie earlier this year last February Israel conducted a daring raid on Iran's secret atomic archive we obtained over 100,000 documents and videos that had been stashed in vaults in an innocent-looking building in the heart of Tehran in May I presented a short summary of what we obtained to the international media I provided hard evidence of Iran's plans to build nuclear weapons and its plans to deceive the international community Israel shared this information and even more damning evidence that we found with members of the p5 plus one and with the International Atomic Energy Agency months have passed the IAEA has still not taken any action it has not posed a single question to Iran it is not demanded to inspect a single new site discovered in that secret archive so given this inaction I decided to reveal today something else that we have shared with the IAEA and with a few intelligence agencies what I'm about to say has not been shared publicly before today and the disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran's secret nuclear weapons program in May we exposed the site of Iran's secret atomic archives right here in the shore Abad district of Tehran today I'm revealing the site of a second facility Iran's secret atomic warehouse it's right here in the tucán Abad district of Tehran just three miles away let me show you exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like here it is you see like the atomic archive it's another innocent looking compound now for those of you at home using Google Earth this no longer secret atomic warehouse is on Mario Ali Mar Street you have the coordinates you can try to get there and for those of you who try to get there it's 100 meters from the color showy the rug cleaning operation by the way I hear they do a fantastic job cleaning rugs there but by now they may be radioactive rugs this is the second secret site now countries with satellite capabilities may notice some increased activity on Meir Ali in the days and weeks ahead the people they'll see scurrying back and forth are Iranian officials desperately trying to finish the job of cleaning up that site because you see since we raided the atomic archive they've been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse just last month they removed 15 kilograms of radioactive material you know what they did with it that 15 kilograms of radioactive material they had to get it out of the site so they took it out and they spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the evidence the endangered residents of Tehran may want to know that they can get a Geiger counter on Amazon for only $29.99 as of today that's just four million Iranian rial but we'll get to that later I'll talk about the Iranian economy in a minute they took this radioactive material and spread it around to Iran now the Iranian officials cleaning out that site still have a lot of work to do because they've had at least at least 15 ship containers they're gigantic 15 ship containers full of nuclear related equipment and materials stored there now since each of those containers can hold 20 tons of material this means that this site contained as much as 300 tons 300 tons of nuclear related equipment and material right here so distinguished delegates you have to ask yourself a question why did he Iran keep a secret atomic archive and a secret atomic warehouse because after all when South Africa in Libya when they gave up their nuclear programs the first thing they did was to destroy both the archives and the material and equipment and the answer to the question is simple the reason Iran didn't destroy its atomic archive and it's atomic warehouse is because it hasn't abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons in fact it planned to use both of these sites in a few years when the time would be right to break out - the atom bomb but ladies and gentlemen rest assured that won't happen it won't happen because what Iran hides Israel will find ladies and gentlemen I have a message to the head of the IAEA mr. Yukiya Amano I believe he's a good man I believe he wants to do the right thing well mr. Amano do the right thing go inspect this atomic warehouse immediately before the Iranians finished clearing it out distinguished delegates you remember when we were promised that inspections could take place anytime anywhere remember that anytime anywhere well how about inspections right here right now Applause and mr. Amano while you're at it inspect the other sites we told you about once and for all tell the world the truth about Iran now I also have a message today for the tyrants of Tehran Israel knows what you're doing and Israel knows where you're doing it Israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons not now not in 10 years not ever Applause and Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran's aggression we will continue to act against you in Syria we will act against you in Lebanon we will act against you in Iraq we will act against you whenever and wherever we must act to defend our state and to defend our people Applause distinguished delegates three years ago a few weeks after the nuclear deal was completed I asked this question from this very podium does anyone seriously believe that flooding Iran's radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression but many of the deal supporters believed just that they believed that Iran's regime would become more moderate more peaceful they believed that Iran would use the billions of dollars it received in sanctions relief to improve the lives of its people to solve the water problem to solve the trucking problem to solve the electricity problem hospitals schools that's what they believe perhaps many of you also believe that well this didn't happen instead Iran used the money to fuel its vast war machine just as past year Iran is attacked Kurds in Iraq slaughtered Sunnis in Syria armed Hezbollah in Lebanon financed Hamas in Gaza fired missiles into Saudi Arabia and threatened freedom of navigation in the Straits of Hormuz and the Strait of bab-el-mandeb some peace some moderation now if you think if you think that Iran's aggression has been confined to the Middle East think again last month two Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks right here in the United States and several weeks ago the Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks in the heart of Europe yet while the United States is confronting Iran with new sanctions Europe and others are appeasing Iran but trying to help it bypass those new sanctions now I've just used a word a tough word a very strong word appeasement and I use it reluctantly but unfortunately that's exactly what we're seeing again in Europe think about this the same week Iran was caught red-handed trying to murder European citizens European leaders were rolling out the red carpet for president rouhani promising to give Iran even more money I'm a historian son I have to ask I asked it not merely as a historian son I ask it as a Jew as a citizen of the world as someone who's lived through the 20th century have these European leaders learned nothing from history will they ever wake up well we in Israel we don't need a wake-up call because Iran threatens us every day because despite the best hopes and there were many hopes around the nuclear deal this deal did not push war further away it brought war ever closer to our borders in Syria Iran is trying to establish permanent military bases against us and has already launched missiles and drones into our territory in Gaza Iran is arming terror groups to launch rocket attacks into our cities and terror attacks against our civilians in Lebanon in Lebanon Iran is directing Hezbollah to build secret sites to convert inaccurate projectiles into precision guided missiles missiles that can target deep inside Israel within an accuracy of 10 metres Hizballah listen to this Hezbollah is deliberately using the innocent people of Beirut as human shields they've placed three of these missile conversion sites along Beirut's International Airport here's a picture that's worth a thousand missiles here's Beirut International Airport here's the first missile site it's in the OSI neighborhood on the water's edge a few blocks away from the runway here's the second site it's underneath a soccer stadium that's the soccer stadium two blocks away and here's the third site it's adjacent to the airport itself right next to it so I have a message for Hezbollah today Israel knows Israel also knows what you're doing Israel knows where you're doing it and Israel will not let you get away with it Applause ladies and gentlemen just as the nuclear deal supporters were wrong about what would happen when sanctions would be removed they were wrong dead wrong about what would happen when sanctions would be restored they argued that US sanctions alone would have little impact little economic impact on Iran that's what they said really well let's see what happened to Iran's economy now that President Trump has forced companies to choose between doing business with Iran and doing business with the United States whose GDP is 50 times the size of Iran's GDP a year ago Iran's economy was booming now it's collapsing Iran's currency is plummeting inflation and unemployment are soaring British Airlines German banks French oil companies Japanese all importers and many others are scrambling to get out if that's little economic impact imagine what will happen with the next batch of US sanctions imposed in November the deals supporters were also wrong when they argued you have to believe that they argue this I mean I had many arguments with them they also argued that removing sanctions story that restoring sanctions would rally the Iranian people around the regime well they're definitely rallied but not around the regime they're rallying against the regime they're not chanting death to America they're chanting death to the dictator they're not chanting export their Islamic Revolution they're chanting leave Syria leave Lebanon leave Gaza take care of us in Iran I listen to these protests I talk to the Iranian people I show these videos and I get so many responses some Iranians at first I thought these are Iranian exiles in the safety of London or Paris or Los Angeles now Iranians from Iran embracing Israel criticizing their regime that's an understatement with their names and I asked my intelligence people what's going on and shortly after the protests broke out not because of what I said but it was an indicator of something extraordinary that was taking place there because in these protests the Iranian people are showing unbelievable courage from the urban centers to the outlying villages and it's embracing now the whole of Iran from the striking Bazaar merchants to the young women uncovering their hair the people of Iran are bravely standing up to a regime that is brutally repressed them for four decades and that is squandered their money still squanders their money and bloody wars across the Middle East so here's what I say to Europe's leaders and to others instead of coddling Iran's dictators join the US and Israel and most of the Arab world in supporting new sanctions against the regime that endangers all of us and all of the world Israel is deeply grateful to president Trump for his bold decision to withdraw from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran many many of our Arab neighbors are also grateful and everyone who cares about the peace and security of the world should also be grateful but ladies and gentlemen I have an important confession to make this may surprise you but I have to admit that the Iran deal has had one positive consequence an unintended one but a positive consequence by empowering Iran it brought Israel and many Arab states closer together than ever before closer together than ever before in an intimacy and friendship that have not seen in my lifetime and would have been unimaginable a few years ago Applause and you know when you form friendships around a threat around a challenge you quickly see opportunities not only for security but how to bring the better life for our people which Israel can help and wants to help do Israel deeply values these new friendships and I hope the day will soon arrive when Israel will be able to expand peace a formal peace beyond Egypt in Jordan to other Arab neighbors including the Palestinians I look forward to working with President Trump and his peace team to achieve that goal I also want to use this opportunity we're here at the UN place I know because I served here as ambassador many years ago for many years so I know something about the UN so I want to use this opportunity to express Israel's appreciation to President Trump and ambassador Haley for the unwavering support they've provided Israel at the United Nations Applause they have unequivocally backed Israel's right to defend itself they rightly pulled out of a history denying UNESCO in a morally bankrupt UN Human Rights councils they have more resolutions about Israel than the rest of the world combined I think and tenfold compared to I don't know Iran Syria you name not even ten fold because you can't multiply zero by any number they stopped funding President Trump and ambassador Halley they stopped funding an unreformed Unruh an organization that instead of solving the Palestinian refugee problem perpetuates it day after day the Trump administration is stood up to what has long been a specialty here at the UN slandering Israel even though the shameful resolution comparing Zionism to racism was repealed 25 years ago I'm sorry to say that it's foul stench still clings to these halls Israel airlifted Ethiopian Jews to freedom and a new life in Israel in the Jewish state yet here at the UN here at the UN Israel is absurdly accused of racism Israel's Arab citizens vote in our elections serve in our Parliament preside over our courts and have exactly the same individual rights as all other Israeli citizens yet here at the UN Israel is shamefully accused of apartheid today there are at least five times as many Palestinians as there were in 1948 the year of Israel's founding yet here at the UN Israel is outrageously accused of ethnic cleansing ladies and gentlemen you know what this is it's the same old anti-semitism with a brand new face that's all it is Applause once it was the Jewish people that were slandered and held to a different standard today it's the Jewish state that is slandered and held to a different standard here's an example take the outlandish attacks that have been leveled against Israel after our Knesset our Parliament recently adopted a law declaring Israel the nation-state of the Jewish people mind you Israel is a free country you can you can oppose this law and people did you can call for different wording and this or that Clause or you can call to add or subtract a clause you can do that but when Israel is called races Israel is called races for making Hebrew its official language and the Star of David its national flag when Israel is labeled an apartheid state for declaring itself the nation-state of the Jewish people this is downright preposterous and you know why because represented in this Hall today are more than 100 countries that have only one official language even though many other languages are commonly spoken within those countries there are more than 50 countries here that have crosses or crescents on their flags even though many have non-muslims and non-christians many of them living in their midst and there are dozens of countries that define themselves as nation states of a particular people even though there are many ethnic and national minorities within their borders none of these countries are denigrated or libeled for celebrating very national identity only Israel is denigrated only Israel is libeled what is unique about the Jewish people is not that we have a nation-state what is unique is that many still opposes having a nation-states moments ago President Abbas outrageously R graciously said that Israel's nation state law proves that Israel is a racist apartheid State President Abbas you should know better you wrote a dissertation denying the Holocaust your Palestinian Authority imposes death sentences and Palestinians for selling land to Jews did you hear that if a Jew buys an apartment a piece of land anywhere in the Palestinian territories the Palestinian who sold them that land is executed that's what the law says President Abbas you proudly pay Palestinian terrorists who murder Jews in fact the more they slay the more you pay that's in their law - and you condemn Israel's morality you call Israel racist this is not the way to peace this is not the way to achieve the peace we all want and need and to which Israel remains committed this body should not be applauding the head of a regime that pays terrorists the UN should condemn such a despicable policy and the UN the UN which brokered a ceasefire in 2014 should demand that Hamas release our fallen soldiers who own shell and a dark golden who was kidnapped when Hamas violated that very ceasefire Hamas should also release the two Israeli citizens it holds captive a Barrowman gusto and Hisham a scientist ladies and gentlemen every time I stand here I feel as I do today I am privileged to stand here is the Prime Minister of the Jewish and democratic state of Israel some believe that Israel cannot be both Jewish and democratic this is false Israel is both and Israel will always remain both ever since Abraham and Sarah made their journey to the promised land nearly 4000 years ago the Land of Israel has been our homeland it's the place where Isaac and Rebekah Jacob Leah and Rachel carried on their eternal covenant with God it is where Joshua made us a sovereign nation where David ruled and Isaiah preached where the Maccabees fought and where Masada fell it's the place from which we were exiled and to which we returned rebuilding our ancient and eternal capital Jerusalem Applause the nation-state of Israel is the only place where the Jewish people proudly exercise our collective right of self-determination that right was recognized nearly a century ago by the League of Nations and over 70 years ago by the United Nations when it voted to establish or rather to support the establishment of a Jewish state that's what it said that resolution a Jewish state at the same time Israel is a vibrant democracy where all its citizens Jews and non-jews alike enjoy equal individual rights and these rights are guaranteed by law in Israel whether you're a Jew or an Arab a Christian or a Muslim a Druze or a Bedouin or anything else your individual rights are exactly the same and they will always remain the same in the middle-east that's not obvious now that's an understatement in the Middle East where women are often treated as property minorities are persecuted gays are hanged Israel stands out as a shining example of freedom and progress ladies and gentlemen I could not be more proud to represent my country Israel I'm proud that we've made Israel a global technological power of breathtaking creativity in information technology in precision agriculture you know what that is we target the fertilizer and the water down to the individual plant not field not part of a field down to the plant I'm proud of these geniuses that bring these unbelievable developments in water management's in cybersecurity in autonomous vehicles in digital health in medical devices and in so many other fields that are improving the lives of billions of people around the world I'm proud of Israel's brilliant scholars innovative entrepreneurs talented artists I'm proud of Israel's devoted teachers compassionate doctors in our search and rescue teams who save lives from Haiti to Mexico from Nepal to the Philippines I am proud I'm so proud of Israel's courageous soldiers the men and women who bravely defend our homeland while upholding the highest values Applause and most of all ladies and gentlemen most of all I am proud of the people of Israel who draw extraordinary strength from the deep well springs of our heritage who possess an unbreakable spirit and who are determined as ever to build a secure and magnificent future for the one and only Jewish state thank you Applause on the alpha of the General Assembly I wish to thank the prime minister of the State of Israel his Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu for the statement just made and I request protocol to ask for his Excellency Applause Madam President I rise today to give thanks and celebration for the United States's embassy established in the city of Jerusalem and for the continued safety and security of the Jewish people in Israel and across the world almost exactly 70 years ago Israel's founding father David ben-gurion brought together members the Jewish People's Council in the Tel Aviv Museum to declare the founding of the modern State of Israel eleven minutes later President Harry Truman courageously recognized the State of Israel over the objections of many of his advisers and the State Department and the fates of our two countries had been intertwined ever since until this week when the US Embassy was finally finally finally moved to Jerusalem recognizing that it is the eternal capital of the Jewish people and the undivided capital of Israel I was proud to have traveled to Jerusalem along with my fellow senators for the official opening of the new embassy it was an incredible honor to witness history unfolding a joyous moment for Israelis for Americans a moment of history I had the opportunity to visit with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the incredible significance of ending the 70 years of discrimination that Israel had faced no other country on earth did America have our embassy in a city other than its capital city it was only Israel where our embassy was not in the capital and I would note that for many years presidents of both parties Democrats and publicans have campaigned promising that they would move the embassy to Jerusalem which is the capital of the nation and yet presidents of both parties have failed to do so I commend President Trump for honoring that campaign commitment for delivering on that campaign commitment moving our embassy to Jerusalem is an acknowledgment of undeniable truth that Jerusalem is in fact the capital of the nation of Israel it is where we find the Knesset is where we find the Supreme Court it is where we find the Prime Minister it is where we find the president of Israel it is the capital city and now our embassy reflects that fact but moving the embassy and recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has significance beyond that it has significance because it is an unmistakable message to our friends and to our enemies that the United States stands with our friends and stands unshakably alongside the nation of Israel there was considerable debate within the administration about if and when to move the embassy that's been true in Prior administration's as well considerable debate and the principal argument against moving the embassy has always been that the enemies of Israel wouldn't like it well that I believe is yet another reason why this was the right thing to do there were some who made the case that moving the embassy would diminish the chances of peace in the Middle East now I'll confess I am skeptical that peace will be attained any time soon I don't believe the impediment to peace in the Middle East is the nation of Israel Israel wants peace it is Israeli babies who are being murdered by the terrorists the barrier to peace I don't believe we will see peace in the Middle East unless and until the Palestinian leadership number one acknowledges Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state and number two renounces terrorists as long as the Palestinian leaders are engaged in a unity government with Hamas on a vowed terrorist organization seeking to destroy the nation of Israel and murder innocent Israelis peace will not be hand but what I urged president trumpet and urged the administration is that moving the embassy increases I believe the chance of peace why is that because it demonstrates that America stands strong stands by our friends and is not shaken is not buffeted by global media opinion I suggested to the administration that our Arab allies in the region they publicly would denounce them if they would have to for domestic political concerns however I believe privately those allies the Egyptians the Jordanians the Saudis privately would be relieved that America moved our embassy why is that because an American president and administration's strong enough to move the embassy and stand up to the nattering nabobs in the press might well also be a president and administration strong enough to stand up to Iran to end the catastrophic Obama Iranian nuclear deal and to do whatever is necessary to prevent the Ayatollah Khomeini from getting nuclear weapons and indeed we saw that assessment was true I think it is quite fitting that the opening of the new embassy occurred just days apart from the president making the historic decision to pull out of the disastrous Obama Iran nuclear deal we are seeing the difference between strength and weakness if history teaches anything it is that weakness and appeasement do not work and instead I think America is far better when we pursue policies of peace through strength we all recognize there are those who rage against the existence of the State of Israel there are the ayatollahs of Iran who swear death to Israel and death to America indeed who refer to Israel as the little Satan in America as the Great Satan and who finance terrorism at Israel's doorstep and across the world there are the terrorists of Hamas who seized control of the Gaza Strip over a decade ago after Israel had already fully withdrawn from the territory for the last several months Hamas has been organizing civilian mobs with terrorist cells embedded throughout to attack Israel's border and the soldiers stationed there they call the riots the march of return in reference to what they call their right of return which is a euphemism for having millions of descendants of Palestinians flood into Israel and destroy the modern State of Israel and its existence as a Jewish state Hamas times they're weeks of riots to culminate this week during what they call knock ba day not knock about means the catastrophe it is the word they use to reference the creation of Israel Madam President we should understand that they denounce every year when Israel celebrates the creation of the modern State of Israel Hamas mourns the catastrophe to use their word that Israel even exists but inevitably in these battles for survival that Israel faces daily we can count on global media elites acting as little more than propaganda arms for Hamas and other terrorists and no week has that been more evident than this week Madam President I direct you to the front page of the New York Times from this week the New York Times is headline Israel kills dozens at Gaza border as US Embassy opens in Jerusalem anyone reading this headline goodness gracious why are the Israelis murdering people that's what the New York Times says one takes from the coverage apparently poor innocent unarmed people are being shot for no reason by Israel that's certainly what the global media elite are portraying what are the actual facts you remember facts the things that used to be reported when journalists were actually being journalists and not propagandists well let's talk about the facts for several weeks we've seen riots and violent attacks at Israel's border terrorist attacks that culminated in the attacks that led to these shootings in self-defense the rioters they use massive tire fires to create smoke to cover their attacks they use guns they use pipe bombs they use Molotov cocktails they use grenades they use mechanical catapults to attack the border and to attack Israeli troops they tie petrol bombs to kites and they launch them to set fire to Israeli fields and livestock's the kites well let's take a look at the kites the kites that they use are painted with swastikas just so you're not confused about their motivations their pictures taken a couple of weeks ago of kites of images of swastikas by the Hamas terrorists with gasoline bombs designed to commit murder and mayhem the Palestinians and the riots they don't hide their motives or intentions it's not that the New York Times can't figure it out it's that they don't care one 23 year old rioter said quote we are excited to storm and get inside and that if he got across the border he would do whatever is possible to kill throw stones Madam President I would note a violent terrorist attacking the border seeking to murder people he's not a peaceful protester as the useful idiots in the media falsely portray them another Hamas terrorist who is flying swastika kite told NPR and this is a quote this is a kite that's going to go to the Jews the Jews go crazy for Hitler when they see it this is actually what we want them to know that we want to burn them now let me remind you again of the New York Times headline the New York Times headline says Israel kills dozens at Gaza border kills dozens of of what of whom do they say terrorists do they say Hamas terrorists flying swastika kites filled with gasoline seeking to murder Israelis who say quote this is actually what we want them to know that we want to burn them a rational person when hearing about brave soldiers protecting innocent civilians from terrorists seeking to murder them that is a good thing when terrorists are stopped before they can carry out their acts of terror but the New York Times can't be bothered to include those facts there is a message to be conveyed and for anyone lacking nuance or subtlety their message is simple Israel bad is real bad that that that's their whole subtlety and mind you the bodies of those poor helpless little terrorists well you know when a terrorist seeks to commit murder we do everything possible to prevent them from doing so so when you read the headline understand this is who the New York Times is celebrating although I ask you Madam President why wasn't the swastika on the cover of the New York Times might people understand it differently if they actually showed photographs of what was happening one of Hamas as Facebook pages posted maps with directions to nearby Israeli communities where thousands of Israelis live within two miles of the border if you look at this map this map is posted so you didn't understand these protesters are not just there saying you know make love man not war New York Times want to paint wants to paint them as some happy little hippies with daisies in their ears just give peace a chance you know John and Yoko are among them well why is Hamas posting this map saying if you cross the border here's where the Israeli communities are to go and murder Israelis here's the map if you make it across the border here's where you can find victims to kill as many of them as possible they're not hiding their intentions this is not subtle if you get across the border your target is wherever you can find Jews to kill these are the terrorists that the New York Times celebrates kills dozens why is it that the New York Times doesn't mention the maps that they have to Israeli homes to murder innocent women and children to kill as many Jews as possible here's a partial list of what happened on the border over just a few hours on Monday at 12:53 p.m. there were five pipe bomb detonations at 12:58 another explosive device was detonated at 1:15 a terror cell opened fire at his Raley soldiers who caught them trying to plant bombs at 1:30 there was another shooting attack at Israeli soldiers at 1:45 there was yet another shooting attack this time by a terror cell of eight using the rioters as cover as human shields at 2:09 there were three more bomb detonations at 2:13 there was a Molotov cocktail attack at 249 there was another Molotov cocktail attack at 310 there was yet another bomb attack and so on and so on and so on that's just two hours we're in the New York Times headline and sadly this is emblematic of much of the global media elite who are unified in their antagonism to the State of Israel where is any acknowledgment pipe bombs Molotov cocktails shooting how would this headline read differently if violet Hamas terrorists opened fire on Israelis who defend innocent civilians taking the lives of the terrorists that actually would be news that actually would be factual that actually would be describing what happened instead of becoming a propagandist for the terrorists the strategy for these riots for these terror attacks it's a win-win for Hamas if they breach Israel's fence then their terrorists can rush into Israeli towns try to kidnap and kill Israel's civilians if they fail to breach the fence they attacked the fence and Israeli soldiers defend Israel and if they're shot then they know that the media the useful idiots will provide endless photographs and stories denouncing Israel how dare you kill terrorists before they're able to murder innocent civilians the media has been more than happy to oblige Hamas is propaganda needs reporters celebrity Talking Heads and members of our political establishment have faithfully and enthusiastically parroted the Hamas line they say that the riots are the fault of the United States for moving our embassy and that the rioters are peaceful and unarmed protesters there's a word for that it's called a lie and when so-called journalists repeatedly and deliberately lie in the name of propaganda well they shouldn't be surprised to have earned the moniker fake news the Hamas talking points which are printed by our media are aimed at whitewashing the terrorists genocide 'el hatred of Israel in fact these attacks are waged because Hamas refuses to accept the existence of Israel mind you Gaza they control Israel doesn't govern Gaza Hamas governs Gaza this is an attack on the border of Israel seeking to murder innocent civilians the New York Times has been unremitting in its dishonesty they told their tens of thousands of Facebook followers that Israel quote use tear gas and gunfire to keep Palestinian protesters from crossing the border fence with Gaza killing at least 52 according to Palestinian officials 40 miles away officials celebrated the US Embassy's relocation to Jerusalem once again let's pull up the kites this is the New York Times pretending to report Israel used tear gas and gunfire to keep Palestinian protesters from crossing the border fence with Gaza killing at least 52 these are not protestors these are terrorists seeking to murder people when you call a terrorist a peaceful and unarmed protestor directly contrary to the facts you're not engaged in journalism you're pursuing a political agenda on the pages of the old grey link their websites headline on Monday blared Israel kills 58 and injures over 1300 by gunfire at Gaza border a mass attempt by Palestinians to cross the border fence quickly turned violent as Israeli soldiers responded with rifle fire gosh we're in their headlines we're in their coverage is any mention that these are terrorists with bombs and guns and Molotov cocktails and kites carrying gasoline no no no these were just protesters who for no reason whatsoever those bad bad Israelis decided to shoot they just got up and said let's just shoot a bunch of people that's what the New York Times tells us for no reason whatsoever they just began firing into the crowd by the way if you go in to the fever swamps of social media and you see the left the New York Times knows what it's propaganda does it's not hard to find people on Twitter suggesting that for no reason Israeli just began shooting people cuz you know shooting people is fun because remember their message is not complicated Israel bad and so if Israel bad then you just start shooting people because that's how you approach them on day morning that's the message and it's heard by social media it's heard by anti-semites across the globe it plays into vicious blood libels that go back millennia just happens to be alive not an accidental misstatement a deliberate calculated repeated lie undoubtedly tragically some of those killed have been Palestinians civilian human shields this is by design Madam President part of what Hamas does as it uses terrorists to commit acts of terror and then it uses innocent Palestinians as human shields trying to get them killed because that serves their propaganda purposes although I will say consistently during these riots it's turned out that a great many of the deaths are of the actual Hamas terrorists picked off while planting bombs and attacking Israeli soldiers the American military had been able to shoot the terrorists on 9/11 who flew airplanes into the World Trade Center who flew an airplane into the Pentagon the military had been able to stop those terrorists and shoot those terrorism in the New York Times reading the headline would read American military shoots peaceful flying passengers when you stop a terrorist seeking to commit murder it is not shooting a peaceful protester during past riots Hamas has acknowledged that up to 80% of those killed were terrorists this time around already between 1/3 and 1/2 of those killed have been identified as terrorists look this is Hamas telling you this the people being shot our avowed terrorist there's no dispute that Hamas is a terrorist organization there's no dispute this is their wall of martyrs these are the terrorists that we have sent who were killed where was the word terrorist in the coverage now you saw on TV images of violence on the border juxtaposed with the image of the embassy unveiling no doubt intended to put the blame for the attempted terrorism to put the plane blame on the United States how dare the United States of America actually stand with Israel how dare America open an embassy in the capital of Israel the blame for the violence lies with the terrorists not America for standing with our friend you know what these terrorists they hated Israel they hated Jews and they hated America before we moved our embassy and their compatriots hate America hate Israel and hate Jews after we moved our embassy their hatred their murderous religious zealotry is the cause of the murder of the violence a Hamas spokesman went further on TV and said that in the last round of confrontations if 62 people were martyred 50 of them were Hamas but gosh Madam President the New York Times just said a bunch of unarmed protestors were standing there when for no reason Israeli soldiers began shooting them what complete mendacity Hamas admits these are Hamas terrorists and yet the media does all they can to hide that imagine the outrage if when the American Embassy in Benghazi was attacked by Ansar al-sharia in 2012 a newspaper had printed quote Americans killed dozens of Libyans by the way that's the exact same headline the New York Times did yes protesters coming to commit murder soldiers fight back to stop them from committing murder fortunately even the New York Times didn't quite have the gall to say that but the facts are comparable the blame for all of the deaths whether terrorist or human shields is on Hamas and Hamas alone any implication otherwise is nothing less than shameful support for genocide 'el terrorism in 2014 I introduced in this body bipartisan legislation along with New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand a Democrat supporting Israel's right to self-defense and condemning Hamas is barbaric tactics specifically condemning the use of human shields as a war crime that resolution passed the United States Senate unanimously that passed the House of Representatives unanimously and yet we see the tactic yet again these terrorists using human shields using innocent Palestinians as human shields precisely because they want them to die because they can trust the global media to carry their message a few years back when Israel faced rocket attacks from Hamas one after the other after the other Hamas had its headquarters in the basement of a hospital indeed some years ago I wrote an op-ed entitled a tale of to hospitals it says you could tell a lot about a society about how they treat their most vulnerable and it compared to hospitals one the ZIF hospital in northern israel which i visited at the time the Zipp hospital had provided over eight million dollars in free medical care to syrians badly wounded in the horrific civil war playing out in syria freely caring for their neighbors being murdered by their own head of government the op-ed contrasted that hospital to the hospital in gaza in whose basement hamas had their headquarters now for hamas it was a win-win scenario option a is that israel refrains from hitting the headquarters because it is in the basement of a hospital that's obviously a win because then the terrorists headquarters doesn't get targeted in a military conflict that ultimately is what happened and the israeli forces did not hit hamas as headquarters but option two from a mosses perspective is also when if israel did strike at their headquarters a military target that was launching military attacks trying to murder israelis then the result would be pictures of dead bodies on CNN in the new york times pictures of patients at that hospital being used as human shields it is Hamas desiring the death of little Palestinian babies newborn in the maternity ward because they knew if Israel actually took out Hamas as headquarters they could take those babies who ammas had used as human shields and they could count on the New York Times can you imagine mr. president the headline in the New York Times Israel bombs babies it's not markedly different from their headline Israel kills dozens at Gaza border it's propaganda as long as Hamas has leaders who manipulate them who lie to the Palestinian people who lie to the world and who used human shields in their bloody terrorist campaign against Israel there can never be hope for peace of prosperity Israel has the right to defend itself and Israel is defending itself I only wish our global media had some tiny passing qualms of guilt to at least pretend to report the news to at least pretend to tell the truth to not function as Hamas as propaganda agents let me see the kites again but instead to tell the truth that when Hamas terrorists say with their Nazi swastika kite bombs that we want the Israelis to know we want them to burn these are the facts they need a report even if it happens to disagree with their political agenda of undermining the State of Israel but fortunately mr. president regardless of the partisan bias regardless of the propaganda that the New York Times and other global media outlets put out America the American people stand and will continue to stand unshakably unshakably alongside our friends and allies the people of Israel and we have reason to celebrate when I was in Jerusalem just a couple of days ago I visited with person after person Israeli and America who were reduced to tears some Holocaust survivors and the phrase I heard more often than anything else was I thought I would never live to see the day well we did live to see the day America's Embassy should have been in Jerusalem 70 years ago it should have been there 60 years ago it should have been there fifty years ago twenty years ago ten years ago one year ago but fortunately America's Embassy is where it belongs today in Jerusalem the once an eternal undivided capital of Israel Jerusalem was the capital of Israel 3,000 years ago and Jerusalem is the capital of Israel today and the United States government recognizes that and just as Harry Truman did 70 years ago is leading the rest of the world to follow suit I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum Thank You mr. president it is shameful for the United Nations that I must stand before you today it is shameful that this meeting is even taking place Jerusalem is the holiest place on earth for the Jewish people it is the capital of the State of Israel period it is a fact that simply cannot be disputed King David declared Jerusalem the city of the Jewish people 3,000 years ago the Jewish Bible mentions Jerusalem 660 times our prayers recall Jerusalem holy name over and over again as our prime minister the first Prime Minister David ben-gurion said and I quote Jerusalem is an inseparable part of the history of Israel of the face of Israel I am holding an original coin it's from 67 ad it says in Hebrew and I quote freedom of Zion look in the envelope in front of you you will see you have a replica of the coin it is clear evidence from the time of our Second Temple it proves the ancient connection of Jews to Jerusalem I were born to Jerusalem is unbreakable no UNESCO declaration no empty speeches no General Assembly resolution will ever drive us from Jerusalem these are the facts this body does not want to heal these are the facts this body wishes to ignore so today I will tell you about another unbreakable bond the unbreakable bond of hypocrisy between the Palestinians and the United Nations some of cautioned that the United States decision is one-sided and harmful to peace the opposite is true it is a one-sided steps of the Palestinians and the UN that have pushed away peace for years with every anti-israel resolution with every attack on my people the UN has perfected its double standard we are now sitting in an open session an emergency session of the General Assembly this session has been open since 1997 we live in a world that is full of conflict and war but only when it to Israel the one through democracy in the Middle East that this assembly remain in a constant open session how many times as Israel reached its hand in peace since 1997 how many times have we offered the Palestinians to join us in dialogue how many times of these calls for peace been rejected all of us all of us have lost count when Prime Minister Barack offered the Palestinians a state in 2000 we were met with suicide bombers or our buses and shootings in our streets in 2005 by Minister Sharon disengaged from Gaza he removed every single Israeli home you will not find any settlements any occupation in Gaza anymore since then we have been attacked again and again with rockets and missiles aimed at our civilians yet this body was silent the United States simply stated a fact they officially declared what has always been true Jerusalem has been and always will be the capital of the state of Israel those who support today's resolution are like puppets you are puppets pulled by the strings of your Palestinian puppet masters you are like marionettes forced to dance while the Palestinian leadership looks on with glee you are blind to the lies unaware of the manipulation surrounding you just like a puppet this vote is nothing more performance of delusion the Palestinians know this resolution is a fraud they know this resolution that absolutely nothing for the light of the Palestinian people they know it won't create jobs for their people they know it won't provide better health care for the people of Ramallah or Gaza no this resolution is nothing more than a distraction all it will do is tell the Palestinians they can continue rejecting peace and if you vote for it you are sanctioning that view I thank those brave countries that do not support this resolution you have not fallen prey to the puppet show before us you are the defenders of real peace you are the leaders who prove that no UN resolution can rewrite history because when a UN resolution designates Israel's presence in Palace of Jerusalem as illegal in reality it designates the presence of the Jewish people at the western wall as a legal mr. president for thousands of years Jews had only partial access over even banned completely from the Western world other nations kingdoms and empires that occupied Jerusalem over the centuries had no respect for freedom of religion but when Israel was founded we established a strong democracy our democracy is based on individual freedoms one of those freedoms is the freedom of religion in all these years later our democracy and our commitment to those freedoms continue to thrive we know Jerusalem is sacred to billions around the world is well respects all religions and encourages everyone to visit and pray in the holy city mr. president there is a particular irony with today's resolution countries that sponsor today's resolution accuse the United States and Israel of violating international law countries like Yemen well terror groups like al-qaeda and Isis find fertile ground the ione continues in every other scenario this body preaches human rights and peace but not when it comes to Israel in fact you completely ignore the effect acts of terror that threaten is very citizens these past two weeks alone obscene 23 rocket attacks by Hamas into Israel we heard nothing from the UN no Security Council meeting no emergency session of the General Assembly nothing the PA threatened violence and days of Rage but the UN had no condemnation mr. president let me be clear violence and terror must never be tolerated if this body were really well tell Kahneman and I now give the floor to his Excellency Israel cats Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel Music excellencies ladies and gentlemen I Israel cuts son of Holocaust survivors mayor and Malka cuts made a Western peace and proud to stand here today at the podium of the United Nations of the Foreign Minister of the State of Israel for me this is a very moving moment in 1947 the UN recognized the right of the Jewish people to its own state in the Land of Israel and 71 years ago we established the State of Israel since then we have dependent and developed our homeland and today the State of Israel is strong and advanced a startup nation that leads in many fields Israel is a real democracy for all of its citizens Jewish and non-jewish alike but first of all Israel if the nation-state of the Jewish people based on thousands of years of Jewish history and the right of the Jewish people to its own homeland just as the UN decided 72 years ago I want to thank the President of the United States Donald Trump for his historic and brave decision to recognize Jerusalem the eternal capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years as the capital of Israel and to relocate the American Embassy to Jerusalem I call on all countries to follow the United States and to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel no one can separate the Jewish people from our historical homeland and no one can separate us from Jerusalem our eternal capital Israel wants peace with all its neighbors we sign peace agreement with Egypt and Jordan and are walking today to advance our relations with many Arab state in the region we call on the palestinian authority to stop incitement to stop encouraging and financing terrorism and to recognize the right of the Jewish people to its own state we call on the Palestinians to come back to direct negotiations without any preconditions in Gaza the terrorist organization Hamas is holding two Israeli citizens of our melody stone and sham and side and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers Hadar Goldin in a horn I call on the UN to implement the decisions that you took on this issue and not allow any country to provide a together until Hamas returns them to their families the other day I heard president Allen attacks Israel and I want to say to him you that brutally oppress the Turkish people slaughter the Kurdish minority and support the terror organization Hamas you are the last one that can lecture Israel you are not the Sultan and tokey is not the Ottoman Empire shame on you the main problem threatening stability and security in the Middle East is a one which threatens to destroy Israel and works against the regimes of many countries in the region Iran uses its proxy to organizations his balloon Lebanon Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza the hood is in Yemen and shi'ite militias in Syria in Iraq against Israel and also against other state in the Middle East we recently saw a serious escalation in which a won and missiles were launched from Iran against Saudi oil facilities in order to destabilize world also flies this terror attack against Saudi Arabia was done on the direct orders of Iranian leader Ali Tamina e Iran is the biggest devil state and the biggest sponsor of terror in the world I call on the international community to unite in order to stop Iran the world cannot allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons the world cannot allow Iran to develop ballistic missiles and the world must stop Iran from supporting terror organizations in the region the UN must declare Hizballah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards of terror organizations they promote arrow in the Middle East Europe Latin America and all over the world and the world must stop them I call on the international community to support president wants maximum pressure policy against Iran this is the way to stop them we must stop one today in order to prevent war tomorrow and to the Iranian leadership I say in their own language juju or hooray for his Mishima one you don't count the birds till the end of the phone it isn't over till it's over excellencies ladies and gentlemen the reality in the Middle East also present opportunities for cooperation and advancing the economy of all countries in recent years Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have developed the trucks for regional peace initiative which will connect the Arab Gulf states by well through Jordan to the Israeli port in Haifa it will provide them a faster shorter and safer outlet to the Mediterranean we are also going to connect the Palestinian Authority to this project and this will boost their economy I presented this initiative to the UN Secretary General when we recently met in Abu Dhabi and invited him to take part in this important project Israel has a clear policy to advance ties a normalization with Arab Gulf states we have no conflict with the Gulf states and we have common interest in the field of security against the Iranian faiths as well as in developing many joint civilian initiatives Israel have a lot of capabilities in many areas including high-tech innovation agriculture and water technology which can help the Gulf states and the Gulf states have a lot of capabilities that can help Israel as well I hope the dis cooperation will lead to the signing of peace agreements between our countries as we did with Egypt and Jordan allow me to conclude with the words of the prophet Isaiah two thousand of years ago invited all the nations of the world to come to pray in Jerusalem Bhavya team L how could she the FEMA team the vet ability although the embassy frame Leggett Salam is betray ki beti bet the fee like a rain the whole army I will bring them to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all people as we are about to celebrate the Jewish New Year I would like to close with the traditional Jewish blessing for

this podium is it okay what the heck I'm the Prime Minister thank you great good to see you thank you I'll get there - don't worry great to see you thank you so so today I want to ask you you remember that great Clint Eastwood movie the good the bad and the ugly well I want to talk about the good the bad and the beautiful the good are all the good things that we are doing in Israel that are helping to make the world a better place the bad are all the bad things that malevolent forces are trying to do to Israel and to the world and specifically I'm talking about Iran and the beautiful well that our leave to the last so first the good news Israel has never been stronger militarily tremendously strong that's an f-35 fighter plane the most advanced in the world that's an Iron Dome interceptor and many other systems that we developed with the help of America Thank You America thank you successive American presidents Thank You Congress Republicans and Democrats alike thank you way back for helping bring this about you're terrific and this this incredible this incredible military is buttressed by superb intelligence unmatched in the world can you see me I can hardly see you I have to get closer yeah I see that's good superb intelligence you know in the last few years Israel's incredible intelligence services have foiled dozens dozens of major terrorist attacks across the world in dozens of countries that plane a plane like that could have been blown out of the sky if it weren't for Israeli intelligence a plane heading from Australia to the Persian Gulf you're boarding planes when you leave this place you are safer because of Israeli intelligence it not only protects Israeli lives it protects innocent lives around the world and we're able to do all this because of the extraordinary soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces men and women look at men and women black and white religious and secular gay and straight Jews Muslims Christians Druze citizens they come from different backgrounds but they're united with a common mission to protect the State of Israel they keep us safe they make us proud thank you now I know now I know there are quite a few veterans of the Israeli army here so I want you to stand up I want you to be recognized stand up stand up but the good news the good news doesn't stop merely with Israel's strong military it continues with Israel's strong economy it's a tremendously strong economy and I'll tell you we made it stronger by moving Israel to free-market principles which unleashed the spark of genius embedded in our people into innovation entrepreneurship and there's a revolution taking place this couldn't happen at the the better time look at the ten leading companies in 2006 five energy companies one one IT company Microsoft in a mere ten years later 2016 a blink of an eye in historical terms it's completely reversed five IT companies one energy company left the true wealth is an innovation you know these companies Apple Google Microsoft Amazon Facebook guess what they all have research centers in Israel all of them major research centers and they're not alone there are hundreds more and there's a reason something is going on it's a great change it's you want to hear jargon one sentence this is a terrible sentence but I have no other way to say it's the confluence of big data connectivity and artificial intelligence okay you get that you know what that does it revolutionizes old industries and it creates entirely new industries so here's an old industry that Israel was always grading agriculture we always good in agriculture but now we have precision agriculture you know what that is see that drone in the sky he's connected to a big database and there are sensors in the field and in the field there's irrigation and drip fertilization and now we can target with this technology the water that we give the fertilizer that we give down to the individual plant that needs it that's precision agriculture that's Israel unbelievable you know we were always good in water I want you to see how good we are so we recycle almost 90 percent of our waste water the next country with less than 20% is Spain you can see how Israel what it does for water what it does for the environment so when you take these two things agriculture and water and the other technologies that we apply in both we can change the world we are we are I just heard about an African woman in Africa has to walk eight hours a day to give water to her children four hours one way to a well four hours back and the youngest rarely company brought in this technology that improves on Moses remember Moses he brought water from Iraq they bring water from thin air they bring water to Africa to millions of people in Africa Israeli technology and I was just recently in India that's my friend Prime Minister Narendra Modi great friend I'm showing him cherry tomatoes this is in Gujarat India this is Israeli technology and what I heard there was fantastic farmers came from the region there's an experimental farm there in a place where Israel gives technology know-how to Indian farmers 65 of India 65 percent of India's population our farmers and one farmer after the other gets up and says because of Israeli technology I've increased my crop yields and my income three times four times five times Israel is changing the world in India in Asia in Africa and Latin America everywhere these are the old industries now there are new industries Israel is literally how can I say this Israel is literally driving the world I'm talking about autonomous vehicles Israel is a world leader in autonomous vehicles 500 tech companies that sprang out almost instantaneously and one of them mobile I up there on the left was just sold to Intel for the paltry sum of fifteen billion dollars but the interesting thing is that Intel said to them here are the keys to our 30 worldwide autonomous vehicle businesses you run it Israeli technology is driving the world and one last industry there are many more but one more that you're all familiar with you have bank accounts you should okay well you don't want anyone hacking into them right or into your cars or into the planes you ride you need cyber security everybody needs cyber Israel has become a world leader in cyber security look at how much they invest in the hundreds of Israeli startup companies tremendous companies but here's another factor that you should know Israel's population is how much who knows class eight but it's closer to nine but it's about between eight and nine million that's correct and what percentage of that is of the world's population all come Hong it's one tenth of one percent so what percentage do we get of the world global investment in cyber security and private investment in cyber security were one tenth of one percent of the world's population and we get a whopping 20% of global private investment in cyber we're punching we're punching 200 times above our weight not two times not ten times not a hundred times 200 times above our weight that's one heck of a punch very strong now here's how the dots connect because we have this tremendous capacity for security and intelligence and because we have this tremendous capacity for civilian technology for making the lives of people richer safer more productive many countries are coming to Israel because they want to share with us these benefits and that creates the third great change which is a flourishing of Israel's diplomatic relations around the world you know when I joined when I joined the Foreign Service 105 years ago as the DCM to this city Washington the number two in our embassy I think we had about 80 or 90 countries with whom we had diplomatic relations now the number is 160 and there are very few countries left by the way what are we doing with Greenland we got to do something with Greenland where's my advance team go to Greenland they must have some satellite needs or something that we could do there but we are coloring the world blue I've been to Africa three times in 18 months I've been to South America Latin America can you imagine in the 70 years of history of Israel a Prime Minister of Israel never went south of Texas I mean I love Texas but yeah I do but we went to Argentina we went to Argentina to Colombia to Mexico and they say come back come back we want more that is changing all these countries are coming to us India China Mongolia Kazakhstan all of them Azerbaijan Muslim countries first time I visited Australia tremendous far away though so we're coloring the world blue and you know what the numbers you remember people talked about Israel's isolation remember that Israel's isolation pretty soon the countries that don't have relations with us they're going to be isolated there are those who talk about boycotting Israel will boycott them so the good news is very good and it's getting better the bad news and that's the bad news is that bad things are getting worse and they're very bad and when I talk about that we have to deal with this challenge and I'm thinking specifically what do we do about Iran the force behind so much of what is bad is this radical tyranny in Tehran if I have a message for you today it's a very simple one we must stop Iran we will stop Iran when I last spoke here I warned try to warn the world about a nuclear deal that was a threat to the survival of Israel the security of the region the peace of the world I warned that Iran's regime had repeatedly lied to the international community that it could not be trusted I warned that the deal gives Iran a clear path towards developing a nuclear arsenal in little more than a decade and I warned that by removing Iran sanctions Iran's regime would not become more moderate and peaceful but more extreme and belligerent much more dangerous and ladies and gentlemen that's exactly what has happened here is what Iran is doing today can you enlarge that no can you see that yeah okay well darkness is descending on our region Iran is building an aggressive Empire Iran Iraq Syria Lebanon Gaza Yemen more to come now Iran is seeking to build permanent military bases in Syria seeking to create a land bridge from Tartus from Tehran to tattoos on the Mediterranean and in addition to moving its army its Air Force its Navy to Syria to be able to attack Israel from closer hand it's also seeking to develop to build precision guided missile factories in Syria in Lebanon against Israel I will not let that happen we will not let that happen we must stop Iran we will stop Iran last week we read in the book of Esther about an earlier Persian attempt to exterminate our people they failed then then fail now we will never let Iran develop nuclear weapons not now not in 10 years not ever President Trump has made it clear that his administration will not accept Iran's aggression in the region he has made clear that he too will never accept a nuclear-armed Iran that is the right policy I salute President Trump on this and the president has also made it clear that if the fatal flaws of the nuclear deal are not fixed he will walk away from the deal and restore sanctions Israel will be right there by American side and let me tell you Seoul will other countries in the region as we counter Iran's aggression we should always remember we should always remember the brave people of Iran their suffering their hopes their courage women are jailed for removing their hijabs students are tortured tortured and shocked for advocating freedom we stand with those in Iran who stand for freedom now I believe I believe that a day will come when this horrible tyranny will disappear will perish from the earth and at that point the historic friendship between the people of Israel and the people of Persia will be reestablished today we have Haman Amman tomorrow we'll have Cyrus and friendship and peace my friends as we work together to confront the bad there is also potential to advance the good that paradoxically comes from the bad because most of the state in our region know they know very well believe me that Israel is not their enemy but their indispensable ally in confronting our common challenges and seizing our common opportunities this is true for Egypt and Jordan Israel's longtime peace partners but it's also true for many other Arab countries in the Middle East Israel remains committed to achieving peace with all our neighbors including the Palestinians President Trump has made it clear that he is committed to peace I have made it clear that I'm committed to peace we appreciate the efforts of President Trump superb team Jared Kushner Jason Greenblatt and ambassador David Freedman thank you all thank you all for your hard work for peace but to get peace to get peace President Abbas has to embrace peace and to stop supporting terror raise your hands high if you agree with me that President Abbas should stop paying terrorists to murder Jews you know how much he pays he pays about three hundred and fifty million dollars a year to terrorists and their families each year that's about a little less than 10% of the total Palestinian budget that's an incredible number he pays Hakim Awad Hakim Awad is the terrorist who murdered this beautiful family of Eldon Ruth Fogle and their three children including a three-month-old baby girl hadass so he pays Hakeem Adonis murder and over the lifetime of this killer he will be receiving 2 million dollars I have a message for President Abbas stop paying terrorists because what message what message does ascent to Palestinian children it says murder Jews and get rich and I believe President Abbas should find better use for this money to build roads schools hospitals factories build life don't pay death invest in life invest in peace Israel hopes that the passage of the taylor force act will make clear to President Abbas that America has zero tolerance for terror ladies and gentlemen I spoken about the good and the bad there's plenty of both but I want to end with a few words about the beautiful oh that's very kind of you that's very kind of you I love you too thank you who planted her I'm talking about the beautiful alliance between Israel and the United States of America I'm talking about the beautiful alliance that have brought all of you here to Washington the beautiful alliance that you work day in and day out to make stronger and to make better what is this beautiful alliance made up it's made of our shared values that's the wellspring of the great alliance between our two countries and all you have to do is leave this room leave the song and you walk around a few blocks from here and you see these majestic monuments you can learn from them all about our common values you know they come from a certain book a great book a good book it's called the Bible it said that all of us are created in the image of God and those words inspired jefferson when he declared in the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal all women too by the way and that book inspired Abraham Lincoln in the darkest days of America Civil War he found inspiration in the words of our greatest king King David when he said that the wounds of a divided America would heal and the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous just as the stirring words of the prophet amos inspired the great Martin Luther King when he stood before the Lincoln Memorial and promised to carry on his struggle until justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream these values are an inseparable part of America's story they're an inseparable part of Israel's story and today together we are writing a new chapter in our common story a story of freedom of Justice of Peace of Hope and it is because we're inspired by the same ideas because we're animated by the same values that America and Israel have forged an internal bond that can never ever be broken thank you AIPAC god bless Israel god Bless America and God bless the Israel America alliance thank you all thank you Music Applause Music Applause"

checkSpeech = "IBRAHIM MODIBBO UMAR (Nigeria), associating himself with the statement delivered on behalf of the Non‑Aligned Movement, reiterated his delegation’s support for all General Assembly resolutions on Israeli practices in the occupied territories.  He also expressed concern over the effects of settlement expansion on the prospects for a negotiated two‑State solution and urged Israel to stop demolitions, evictions, restrictions on movement and other infringements of Palestinian rights, while calling upon that country to halt and reverse all settlement activity.  Noting the alarming humanitarian situation reported in the Gaza Strip, he called for an end to Israel’s blockade of the enclave.  He went on to express deep concern over the deteriorating situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory on a range of fronts, according to the reports before the Committee and called for the reversal of all negative trends.  Reiterating his delegation’s support for the Special Committee, he called upon Israel, Palestine and others in the region to work together in pursuit of a viable two‑State arrangement."

## Pure Craziness - Using Machine Learning to Gauge the Sentiment of a tweet!!
Allright guys, ****'s about to get crazy!! I don't expect any of you to understand what this code is saying. I don't even expect you to understand what's it's doing. All I want you guys to realize is that we're literally using machine learning to gauge the sentiment of a tweet - and we're only using 100 lines of code!! To start, open up a new Python REPL

In the main.py file:
```python
import nltk
```

Press run. Then after your code finishes running, execute the following lines in the Bash console:
```bash
nltk.download('twitter_samples')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

Next, clear both the main.py file, and the bash console. Paste the following lines of code into your main.py file, and press run:

```python
from nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk.corpus import twitter_samples, stopwords
from nltk.tag import pos_tag
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk import FreqDist, classify, NaiveBayesClassifier

import re, string, random

def remove_noise(tweet_tokens, stop_words = ()):

    cleaned_tokens = []

    for token, tag in pos_tag(tweet_tokens):
        token = re.sub('http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+#]|[!*\(\),]|'\
                       '(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+','', token)
        token = re.sub("(@[A-Za-z0-9_]+)","", token)

        if tag.startswith("NN"):
            pos = 'n'
        elif tag.startswith('VB'):
            pos = 'v'
        else:
            pos = 'a'

        lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
        token = lemmatizer.lemmatize(token, pos)

        if len(token) > 0 and token not in string.punctuation and token.lower() not in stop_words:
            cleaned_tokens.append(token.lower())
    return cleaned_tokens

def get_all_words(cleaned_tokens_list):
    for tokens in cleaned_tokens_list:
        for token in tokens:
            yield token

def get_tweets_for_model(cleaned_tokens_list):
    for tweet_tokens in cleaned_tokens_list:
        yield dict([token, True] for token in tweet_tokens)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    positive_tweets = twitter_samples.strings('positive_tweets.json')
    negative_tweets = twitter_samples.strings('negative_tweets.json')
    text = twitter_samples.strings('tweets.20150430-223406.json')
    tweet_tokens = twitter_samples.tokenized('positive_tweets.json')[0]

    stop_words = stopwords.words('english')

    positive_tweet_tokens = twitter_samples.tokenized('positive_tweets.json')
    negative_tweet_tokens = twitter_samples.tokenized('negative_tweets.json')

    positive_cleaned_tokens_list = []
    negative_cleaned_tokens_list = []

    for tokens in positive_tweet_tokens:
        positive_cleaned_tokens_list.append(remove_noise(tokens, stop_words))

    for tokens in negative_tweet_tokens:
        negative_cleaned_tokens_list.append(remove_noise(tokens, stop_words))

    all_pos_words = get_all_words(positive_cleaned_tokens_list)

    freq_dist_pos = FreqDist(all_pos_words)
    print(freq_dist_pos.most_common(10))

    positive_tokens_for_model = get_tweets_for_model(positive_cleaned_tokens_list)
    negative_tokens_for_model = get_tweets_for_model(negative_cleaned_tokens_list)

    positive_dataset = [(tweet_dict, "Positive")
                         for tweet_dict in positive_tokens_for_model]

    negative_dataset = [(tweet_dict, "Negative")
                         for tweet_dict in negative_tokens_for_model]

    dataset = positive_dataset + negative_dataset

    random.shuffle(dataset)

    train_data = dataset[:7000]
    test_data = dataset[7000:]

    classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_data)

    print("Accuracy is:", classify.accuracy(classifier, test_data))

    print(classifier.show_most_informative_features(10))

    custom_tweet = "I ordered just once from TerribleCo, they screwed up, never used the app again."

    custom_tokens = remove_noise(word_tokenize(custom_tweet))

    print(custom_tweet, classifier.classify(dict([token, True] for token in custom_tokens)))
```

Don't worry if it takes forever for your code to run - expect to wait at least 1-2 minutes while the machine learning model trains itself. In the meantime, prepare to have your mind blown!!

## Last Thoughts
Natural language processing is one of the many powerful technologies that will become a staple of the 21st century. I hope that we've done today will inspire you to continue learning to code, and finding more crazy things to build!
