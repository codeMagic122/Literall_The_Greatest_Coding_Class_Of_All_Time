## Introduction
Today, my goal is to blow your minds! The code we're going to write will be simple - it will be only 10-13 lines in length - but I hope that by the end of our lesson you realize just how powerful a language plus a library can be!

## Importing Dependencies
Dependencies are libraries with functionality that we are able to use. You can think about them as functions that people have created so that it's easier and faster for you to write your code. For web scraping, the two libraries which we will use are Beautiful Soup and Requests

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeauitfulSoup
```
